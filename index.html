    	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center;">Not much but here i will tell you a short and quick idea about me, what I do, my hobbies, my favourites and a short simple story about my future and life! </p>
        <div class="cover_about">
        <p><img src="images/poo.png" />I am an ambitious boy who always looks for improvement. My keen interest was always to learn new skills and explore its depth. Although, my center point of learning all of this is regarding computer science so that I have at least a general idea about what I will do and what to do. Clean and Modern design was always my favourite and so black and white colors are all time favourite of mine. When it comes to music, I am not the guy who like those jumping and lyric songs. I always prefer music over lyric songs and one of my favourite type is progressive house Music. They are really awsome and when it comes to Deadmau5 I like to be the first person in the line to buy his albums. I always have a keen interest in fish keeping, infact I have my own blog website regarding fishkeeping. It is really exciting to find out new facts about fishkeeping and exploring new tanks. When it comes to work, I always deliever my client project perfectly and within smaller time frame. I like detail oriented works and my good communication skill was always the key to a successful work. </p>
        <p>That's it! I like to keep things short and efficient. Scroll below and explore more about my skills, experience, education and my lovely works.</p>

                    <p>After a hard struggle of 2 years, I passed my A-LEVEL with excelent results. It was really a hard time for me to cope up with massive topics within a short time frame but at the end of the day I managed to sum up all the things. My subject list was not much compare to my O-Level subject list as the pressure is too huge in A-level. I took only Physic, chemistry and Mathematics which is more than enough to study any subject in any area. Now my vision is to get admitted in a good University to complete my aim, goal and mission.</p>
